### Layout / plan

Each card will have:
- Image
- list of model colors under image
- price
- in stock / out of stock text
- Buy now button
- usp has the display text for promotional text


### Todo:

#### Reducer:
- get model list per product (to toggle image + color)
- get different type of products 
- loading,loaded - toggle prop in reducer
- unit test (nice to have)

#### React
- per product, show model color options (maybe underneath image)
- create a top bar to switch between product types
- Loading, loaded - set up what to show for fetch status
- move button to useEffect for fetch
